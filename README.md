# reja - a simple SASS toolkit

reja started out as a project to help me have a better understanding of CSS
grid frameworks.  It turns out they aren't too bad!  I plan to continue to develop reja
and eventually use it in production.  There is much work to be done.

**TODO short term:**

- split up main.scss into partials
- DRY up code with SASS mixins and variables
- change variable names to be more semantic

- Add the following:

    - package for distribution and usage as a Ruby Gem or Bower Component
    - styled links
    - styled navbar
    - styled forms
    - glyphs/icons
    - more text styles

**TODO long term:**

- add custom grid and make it easily for the user to manipulate, similar to Bourbon Neat or Susy
- write JavaScript plugins/functions using [sprint](https://github.com/bendc/sprint)
- *possibly* switch to Myth pre-processor

**reja is based on [One% CSS Grid](http://onepcssgrid.mattimling.com/)**
